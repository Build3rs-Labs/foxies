## Project overview :

The project is a decentralized and idle-stacking game, utilizing NFTs and smart contracts to create a rewarding gaming experience for its players. It is based on the original “Wolf Game”
Wolf Game website : https://wolf.game/
We will issue different generations of the game, starting with gen1. This technical
document covers gen1 and gen2 features as this is our priority.

## Game concept :

In order to play the game, the player must mint an NFT.
There are 2 types of playable characters :

- Chickens (90% chance to mint)
- Foxes (10% chance to mint)

## On gen1, the supply is 15,000 units :

- 13,500 chickens
- 1,500 foxes
- The in-game currency is the $EGGS token.
- The game dynamics are based on the interactions between the foxes and the chickens.
- Chickens NFTs can be staked to generate $EGGS each day, but when they try to sell their $EGGS, there is a 50% chance that the accumulated $EGGS gets stolen by a Wolf.
- Additionally, a 20% tax is charged on sold $EGGS and distributed to the foxes NFTs holders.
  Foxes automatically earn 20% of all the $EGGS sold by the chickens and also have a 10% chance of stealing new mints. The rarity of the fox increases the holder's chance of stealing a new mint.
